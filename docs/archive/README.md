### specification-v2.0-draft.md
**Archived:** 2025-11-24
**Original Path:** `docs/specification.md`

This draft specification documented a planned v2.0 architecture using D3.js for layout algorithms. However, the plugin development went in a different direction:

- **Layout Engine:** Implemented using [family-chart](https://github.com/donatso/family-chart) library instead of D3.js
- **Feature Set:** Many features described in this specification were not implemented
- **Current Status:** Charted Roots is at v0.2.3-beta with a stable feature set focused on core genealogical workflows

**Why Archived:**
- Represented unimplemented features and outdated architecture decisions
- Marked as "Draft" and never completed
- More current documentation exists (README, User Guide, Roadmap, Development Guide)
- Preserving for historical context and potential future reference
